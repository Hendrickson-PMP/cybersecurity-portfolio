DNS 53: Responsible for mapping domain name to ip address.

DNS Servers:
-Recursive - handles queries by searching for the IP Address
-Root - directs query to the appropriate TLD
-Authoritative - store DNS records for specific domains and provide definitive answers to queries.
-Caching - temporarily store query results to speed up future requests
-Primary - main authoritative server that holds the original DNS records for a domain.  Managaes updates and changes to DNS zone file.
-Secondary - acts as a backup. Helps improve reliability and redundancy.

PTR                                        Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping IP addresses to domain names.
SRV                                        Defines services and ports for specific applications, like VoIP.
