Three Types of Servers:
1. Desktop
2. Rackmount
3. Blade

Layer 1 - Hub
Layer 2 - Switch
Layer 3 - Routers, Servers, PC

Straight - connects devices on different layers e.g. Routers-Switch, Hub-Switch, or PC-Switch
Crossover - connects devices on same layer e.g. Swithch-Switch, Router-Server, or Hub-Hub
Rollover - connects devices to the console of the switch (out of band management)

Out-of-Band Management - console - managing switch from console
In-Band Management - managing switch from desk

Normally Routers and PCs use MDI
Medium Dependent Interface  Crossover (MDIX) - Hub and Switch

TAPS (Test Access Point)
Frames and Packets passes through device

SPAN/"Port Mirroring" - Frames and Packets pass through a particular port on the switch.

MAC table = CAM (Content Addressable Memory)

Software used on TAP & SPAN devices:
-Wireshark
-tcp dump

Modular       vs.        Fixed
Changeable Ports         Fixed Ports

Port Aggregation - Increase bandwidth and reduce redundancy

Collision Domain                vs.    Broadcast Domain
Hub=Half Duplex                        Switch
                                       FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF


POE - Power Over Ethernet
    - 4 pairs of T/P
    - CAT 5
    - Different frequencies permit electrical power and data at the same time.

PSE - Power Sourcing Equipment POE switch

POE Injector - Converts non POE switch to a POE
