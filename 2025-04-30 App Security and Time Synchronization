HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)	        No encryption; 	                             Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, 	       Basic web communication when security 
                                            data is transmitted in plaintext             packet sniffing, and data interception            is not a concern
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)	Encrypts data using SSL/TLS; 	               Still vulnerable to SSL/TLS misconfigurations,    Secure web browsing, e-commerce transactions, 
                                            ensures data integrity and authentication    outdated certificates, and weak cipher suites	   and online banking    
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)	                Provides encryption and authentication; 	   SSL versions 2.0 and 3.0 are deprecated 	         Older secured websites and legacy systems 
                                            establishes secure communication             due to security flaws like POODLE attack          (deprecated in favor of TLS)
TLS (Transport Layer Security)	            Improved encryption over SSL;                Weak implementations or outdated versions 	       Modern secure web applications, email encryption, 
                                            prevents data tampering                      (TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated)                  VPNs, and online payments
                                            and unauthorized access 



TIME PROTOCOLS 
Protocol	                       Purpose	                             Accuracy	                        Use Cases	                             Network Overhead
NTP (Network Time Protocol)	     Synchronizes clocks over a network	   Typically within milliseconds	  General-purpose applications:          Moderate 
                                                                                                        IT infrastructure, financial systems,  (can work in large-scale networks)
                                                                                                        log synchronization
PTP (Precision Time Protocol)	   Provides highly precise time 	       Typically within nanoseconds	    High-precision industries: telecom, 	 High 
                                 synchronization                                                        aerospace, industrial automation       (requires specialized hardware like PTP-enabled switches)


Key Differences:
NTP is designed for broad use in computers, servers, and IT networks where millisecond accuracy is sufficient.

PTP is used in environments needing extreme precision, such as measuring delays in 5G networks or coordinating robotics systems.

PTP requires specialized hardware (such as boundary clocks and transparent clocks) for accurate synchronization, while NTP works with standard network devices.   

FILE SHARING PROTOCOLS

                                       (encrypted via SSH)        to encryption overhead   system administration
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)	 No encryption; 	          Fast (lightweight)	     Sending firmware updates, boot files,   UDP (Port 69)
                                       minimal authentication                              and configurations

CIFS (Common Internet File System)	   Weak security            	Moderate	               Windows-based file and printer sharing	 TCP (Port 445)
                                       (deprecated in favor 
                                       of SMBv2/v3)

                                       later versions
ATP (AppleTalk Protocol)	             Legacy security; minimal	  Slow (outdated)	         Older macOS systems for file and printer  AppleTalk network stack (legacy)
                                       authentication                                      sharing  

Key Takeaways:
SFTP is preferable for secure file transfers, leveraging SSH encryption.

TFTP is lightweight but lacks security, ideal for network booting and firmware updates.

SMB and NFS are used for file sharing across Windows and Unix/Linux environments, respectively.

Protocol	                              Purpose	                            Type	                       Security Features	                        Use Cases
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)	  Sends emails between mail servers	  Email transmission	         Supports encryption via STARTTLS	          Email delivery from client to server

                                        to client                                                        for SSL/TLS
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)	Synchronizes emails between 	      Email retrieval	             Stronger security than POP3; 	            Keeps emails stored on the server for remote access
                                        server & client                                                  supports SSL/TLS  
VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)	    Transmits voice calls over 	        Communication protocol	     Encryption depends on implementation 	    Internet-based phone calls
                                        the internet                                                     (SRTP, TLS)
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)	      Establishes and manages VoIP 	      Signaling protocol	         Supports encryption and authentication	    Used in VoIP call setup, video conferencing
                                        sessions
ADC (Advanced Data Communication)	      Improves data transmission & 	      Network communication	       Typically works at transport layer, 	      Used in high-speed data transfer and enterprise networks
                                        efficiency                                                       varies by application
RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)	    Handles real-time media streaming	  Media transmission protocol	 Can be encrypted using SRTP	              Used in VoIP, video streaming, online gaming


Key Differences:
SMTP, POP3, and IMAP focus on email communication, while VoIP, SIP, RTP relate to voice and media streaming.

POP3 downloads email to the client, while IMAP keeps it synced with the server for cloud-based access.

SIP manages VoIP signaling, while RTP handles media transmission during voice/video calls.

ADC is more about optimizing data communication rather than a specific messaging format.
