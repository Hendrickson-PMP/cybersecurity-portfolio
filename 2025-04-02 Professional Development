Harnessing My Strengths and Weakness for Growth and Opportunity
Strengths:
1. Relationship-Building & Influence
My experience in project management and stakeholder communication shows that I‚Äôm great at building relationships and influencing others.
-As a Financial Advisor, I had to build trust with clients and guide them toward the best financial decisions.
-My ability to work with cross-functional teams (IT, cybersecurity, business operations, etc.) shows that I thrive in collaborative environments.

2. Success-Oriented & Achievement-Driven 
I've led high-impact projects in cybersecurity, financial services, and compliance, all of which required strategic planning and execution.
-My PMP certification highlights my dedication to professional growth and excellence.
-I‚Äôve worked in industries that demand results, like cybersecurity compliance (PCI DSS) and project management, where meeting deadlines, budgets, and quality standards are crucial.

3. Service & Helping Others 
My mentorship and leadership experience in building high-performing teams aligns with my strength of service and helping others.
-My work in financial advising and project management involves guiding people toward better decisions‚Äîwhether in financial security or IT.
-I‚Äôve contributed to reducing security risks (like data leakage and breaches), which ultimately helps organizations and people.

My blend of people skills, leadership, and achievement-driven mindset makes me a strong fit for roles that require strategic relationship management, influence, and structured execution‚Äîlike project management, consulting, and leadership in cybersecurity.


Weaknesses:

1. People-Pleasing & Overcommitment
Early in my career taking on too many responsibilities in projects to avoid disappointing stakeholders. Overextending myself and mentoring others at the expense of my workload. Plus, struggling to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to additional tasks, led to burnout.
-Over the years I have trained myself to guard against this through setting clear boundaries on my workload and prioritizing high-impact tasks.
-Remembering that saying ‚Äúno‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make me less valuable‚Äîit protects my efficiency.

2. Emotional Exhaustion & Burnout
Becoming emotionally drained from constantly supporting team members, clients, or stakeholders.  Feeling resentful when help isn‚Äôt reciprocated or when people take advantage of your generosity.  Struggling to disconnect from work, especially with time-sensitive demands.
-I manage this through prioritizing self-care and downtime‚Äîburnout will only hinder my effectiveness.
-I choose projects where I feel valued and respected, not just needed.

My natural poise, drive, and people skills make me a great leader, mentor, and project manager. However, I watch out for burnout and overcommitting. Setting clear boundaries and focusing on self-worth outside of work helps me maximize my strengths without feeling drained.
