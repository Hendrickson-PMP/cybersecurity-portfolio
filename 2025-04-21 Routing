Routing refers to the best route or path for the passage of data through the network.

2 Types of Routing
1. Static Routing - Routes are manually configured and manually updated. 
                  - Common in smaller, stable network.
                  - Used where security is a concern.
                  - Easy to setup and maintain.
                  - Paths are predetermined.
                  - More efficient
2. Dynamic Routing - Routes are automatically adjusted based on network conditions using protocols like OSPF, BGP, or RIP.
                   - Uses algorthim to determined best path.
                   - Allows routers to automatically adapt to changes in the network.
                   - More flexible and resilient.
                   - More complex to setup.


Routes are based on the following metrics:
-Hops Count
-Speed
-Latency/Delay
-Bandwidth/Cost
-MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) - the largest size of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network in a single frame without fragmentation.
-Traffic

MAC address - tells who you are and seldomly changes.
IP address - tells where you are and changes.

Routers have a Routing Table

Routing Protocols:
1. Distance Vector
     -Routers share routing info with immediate neighbors at set intervals, using metrics like hop count (number of routers a packet must pass through).

     -Pros: Simple to configure and manage.

     -Cons: Slower convergence time (takes longer for the network to update) and potential routing loops.

     -Examples: RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).

2. Link State
     -Routers share detailed topology information about the entire network, not just their neighbors. Each router builds a map of the network and calculates the best path.

     -Pros: Faster convergence and more efficient routing decisions.

     -Cons: Requires more processing power and memory.

     -Examples: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System).

3. Hybrid 
     -How it works: Combines features of both Distance Vector and Link-State routing to optimize performance.

     -Pros: Offers better scalability and efficiency while reducing routing overhead.

     -Cons: Complexity in configuration and implementation.

     -Example: EIGRP (it includes both Distance Vector and Link-State elements).
     
4. External
     -Used to route between different organizations.

     -BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) 
          â€“ Core protocol of the internet, determining paths between autonomous systems. 
          - Used by ISPs for large-scale routing decisions.
