Collision Domain: 
A network segment where data packets can collide with each other when two or more devices attempt to send data simultaneously. Common on hubs.

Broadcast Domain:
A network segment where a broadcast packet can be received by all devices within that segment. Has a router or a switch


                       Layer 2 Switch	                            vs                         Layer 3 Switch
OSI Layer	             Layer 2 (Data Link)	                                                 Layer 3 (Network)
Switching Method	     MAC Address	                                                         MAC & IP Address
Routing Capability	   No	                                                                   Yes (Inter-VLAN Routing)
Broadcast Domains	     One per VLAN	                                                         Multiple (Routes Between VLANs)
Use Case	             Simple LAN Switching	                                                 Complex Network Segmentation


                       Static VLAN                                  vs                       Dynamic VLAN
Assignment Method	     Manually (Port-Based)	                                               Automatically (MAC Address, Authentication, etc.)
Configuration Effort	 High (Manual Setup)	                                                 Lower (Automated Assignments)
Adaptability	         Limited (Fixed to Port)	                                             High (Devices Maintain VLAN Across Ports)
Security	             Higher (Predictable)	                                                 Variable (Depends on Authentication Controls)
