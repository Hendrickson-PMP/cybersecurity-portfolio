Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network
In a Peer-to-Peer network, each device (or "peer") is equal, and they directly share resources (files, printers, etc.) without needing a central server.

Pros:

Simple and cost-effective: No need for expensive servers; just connect devices.

Decentralized: No central point of failure, so the network continues even if one peer goes offline.

Easy to set up: Perfect for small groups or homes.

Cons:

Limited scalability: Works well for small networks but struggles with performance in larger setups.

Less secure: Since there’s no central control, enforcing security can be tricky.

Resource sharing issues: Heavily used peers may slow down the network.

Client-Server Network
This is a more structured system where devices (clients) connect to a centralized server that manages resources and services.

Pros:

Centralized control: Easier to manage users, data, and security.

High scalability: Servers can handle large numbers of clients.

Efficient data management: Centralized data storage simplifies backups and updates.

Cons:

Cost: Setting up servers and maintaining them can be expensive.

Single point of failure: If the server goes down, the entire network is disrupted.

Complex setup: Requires expertise to design and maintain.


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) are both data serialization formats used for storing and exchanging structured data.


Physical Topology
A physical topology refers to the actual arrangement of network devices and cables that connect them. It is the literal, physical layout of the network, which can be observed and mapped. Examples include star, bus, ring, mesh, and tree topologies.

Key Characteristics:

Deals with physical connections like cables, switches, routers, etc.

Shows how devices are physically linked and where hardware components are located.

Important for troubleshooting physical issues, such as cable faults or hardware failures.

Logical Topology
A logical topology represents how data flows through the network. It is more abstract and focuses on data paths and communication between devices, regardless of their physical layout. Logical topology could differ from the physical topology; for example, data may flow in a ring pattern even though devices are physically arranged in a star.

Key Characteristics:

Represents the way devices communicate and share data.

Important for understanding how network protocols, addresses, and rules operate.

Examples include logical bus, logical ring, and broadcast topologies.

In short:

Physical topology is about hardware connections.

Logical topology is about data flow.


Types of Topology:

1. Bus Topology
All devices are connected to a single central cable (the "bus").

Data flows in both directions along the cable.

Pros:

Cost-effective for small networks.

Easy to set up.

Cons:

A single cable failure can bring down the network.

Performance decreases with more devices.

2. Star Topology
All devices connect to a central hub or switch.

Pros:

Easy to manage and troubleshoot.

Centralized control.

Cons:

If the central hub fails, the entire network goes down.

More cables are required.

3. Ring Topology
Devices form a closed loop where each connects to two others, creating a "ring."

Pros:

Easy to add or remove nodes.

Data travels in one direction, reducing collisions.

Cons:

A single point of failure in the loop can disrupt the network.

Troubleshooting is complex.

4. Mesh Topology
Each node connects to every other node, providing redundancy.

Pros:

Highly reliable; no single point of failure.

Good for large, critical networks.

Cons:

Expensive and complex to set up.

High maintenance.

5. Tree Topology
A combination of star and bus topologies, with devices forming branches.

Pros:

Scalable and hierarchical.

Easy to manage.

Cons:

If the root or central backbone fails, the network can break down.

6. Hybrid Topology
A mix of two or more topologies to suit specific needs.

Pros:

Flexible and scalable.

Customizable for different network requirements.

Cons:

Can be complex and costly to design.


OSI Model Layers
Layer 1: Physical Layer

Manages the physical hardware, such as cables, switches, and electrical signals.

Responsible for transmitting raw bits over a medium.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer

Provides error detection and correction for data frames.

Handles the MAC (Media Access Control) addressing.

Layer 3: Network Layer

Manages routing and forwarding of packets between devices.

Uses IP (Internet Protocol) addressing.

Layer 4: Transport Layer

Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and error recovery.

Protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

Layer 5: Session Layer

Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions.

Ensures proper synchronization between systems.

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Converts data formats to ensure compatibility between devices.

Handles encryption, compression, and translation.

Layer 7: Application Layer

Interfaces directly with user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients).

Supports network services like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

Why is the OSI Model Important?
Standardization: It provides a universal language for networking.

Troubleshooting: Helps isolate network issues by identifying the layer where the problem occurs.

Compatibility: Ensures different systems and devices can communicate effectively.


In networking, PDU stands for Protocol Data Unit. It refers to the specific unit of data that is sent and received at each layer of the OSI model. Here's how PDU differs by layer:

PDU Types by OSI Layers
Layer 1: Physical Layer

PDU: Bits The raw binary data transmitted over the physical medium.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer

PDU: Frame A structured unit that includes headers, trailers, and payload for node-to-node communication.

Layer 3: Network Layer

PDU: Packet Contains IP addressing information for routing data across networks.

Layer 4: Transport Layer

PDU: Segment (TCP) or Datagram (UDP) Represents data for end-to-end communication. Segments are used for reliable transport (TCP), while datagrams are used for best-effort delivery (UDP).

Layer 5: Session Layer

PDU: Data Ensures synchronization and session management between devices.

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

PDU: Data Handles encryption, compression, and format translation.

Layer 7: Application Layer

PDU: Data The user interacts with data through applications like web browsers and email clients.

Why are PDUs Important?
PDUs help define how data is packaged, transmitted, and interpreted at each layer. This standardization ensures seamless communication between different devices and systems.


Physical Layer

Physical Layer of the OSI model includes both wired (like twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables) and wireless mediums.

Role of Repeaters
A Repeater is a device that regenerates and amplifies electrical signals. Over long distances, signals can weaken or degrade (this is called attenuation). Repeaters solve this problem by receiving the weak signal, cleaning it up, and retransmitting it at full strength.

How it works at the Physical Layer:

It ensures data transmission over extended distances without loss.

Repeaters don’t interpret the data—they operate purely at the Physical Layer by boosting the signal.

Role of Amplifiers
An Amplifier, on the other hand, increases the strength (amplitude) of the signal. While similar to a repeater, amplifiers simply amplify the signal without distinguishing between the original data and any accompanying noise.

How it works at the Physical Layer:

It helps maintain signal strength in long-distance transmissions.

Unlike repeaters, amplifiers amplify everything, including noise, which can degrade the quality of the signal.


Data Encapsulation
Data encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information as it passes through the layers of the OSI model. Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer), which contains metadata required for that layer's functionality.

How it works:

Data starts at the Application Layer (Layer 7) as user-generated information.

As the data moves down the OSI model, each layer adds its own header (e.g., for addressing, routing, error checking, etc.).

At the Physical Layer (Layer 1), the encapsulated data is transmitted as bits.

Purpose: Encapsulation ensures the data is formatted and packed correctly so it can travel across networks, following each layer's protocol requirements.

Data De-encapsulation
De-encapsulation is the reverse process, where the headers (and trailers) added during encapsulation are stripped off as the data moves up the OSI model at the receiver's end.

How it works:

The raw bits arrive at the Physical Layer (Layer 1).

As the data moves up the layers, each layer removes its corresponding header and processes the remaining data.

By the time the data reaches the Application Layer (Layer 7), the original user-generated information is restored.

Purpose: De-encapsulation ensures the receiver can interpret the data correctly, using only the relevant user information once all protocol-related metadata is removed.

Simplified Example
Think of it like sending a gift:

Encapsulation: Wrapping the gift with multiple layers of packaging (protocols at each layer).

De-encapsulation: Unwrapping the layers until you reach the gift (user data).
