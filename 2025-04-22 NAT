Network Address Translation - Maps private IP addresses with public IP addresses.
NAT - used in routers

Private IP Addresses:
-Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (Used in large networks)

-Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (Used in medium-sized networks)

-Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (Common in home and small business networks)

APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) - a fallback IP address assigned automatically when a device fails to get an address from a DHCP server.

APIPA Address Range
169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255

Used only for local communication within a network—no internet access.

4 Types of NAT
1. Static NAT (One-to-One Mapping) - Incoming Traffic
     -Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address.

     -Useful when a device inside the network needs to be accessible externally (e.g., web servers).

     -Pros: Provides consistency; external users always reach the same IP.

     -Cons: Requires more public IP addresses.

2. Dynamic NAT (Many-to-One Mapping) - Outgoing Traffic
     -Assigns a public IP dynamically from a pool when needed.

     -Used when internal devices need temporary internet access.

     -Pros: Conserves public IPs efficiently.

     -Cons: Does not guarantee the same public IP each time, making external access unreliable.

3. PAT (Port Address Translation) / NAT Overloading - Outgoing Traffic
     -A form of Dynamic NAT that maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different port numbers.

     -Commonly used in home routers.

     -Pros: Maximizes public IP usage and adds a layer of security.

     -Cons: Some applications struggle with NAT traversal due to port-based routing.

4. Port Forwarding - Incoming Traffic
     -A networking technique that allows external devices to access services on a private network by directing specific traffic through a firewall or router.

     -Normally, devices on a private network are hidden from the internet for security.

     -Opens a designated port, allowing incoming connections to be directed to a specific device or service.

     -Done by configuring a router or firewall to forward traffic from a public IP (Internet-facing) to an internal IP (Private network device).
