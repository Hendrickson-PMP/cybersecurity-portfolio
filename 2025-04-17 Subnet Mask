Subnet Mask
A numerical value used in computer networking to divide an IP address into two parts: 
1. Network
2. Host portion.

It helps determine which part of an IP address identifies the network and which part identifies individual devices (hosts) within that network.

Example:
Subnet mask - 255.255.255.0
-First three octets (255.255.255) - represent the network
-Last octet (0) represents the host.

256 IP addresses with 254 usable for devices (excluding the network and broadcast addresses).

Subnet masks are essential for efficient IP address allocation and routing in networks. 

IP Class                Subnet Mask               Cider
Class A                 255.0.0.0                 /8
Class B                 255.255.0.0               /16
Class C                 255.255.255.0             /24

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol - Resolves IP address to MAC address.
