2. Wireless 
   -Antennae

1. Types of Twisted Pair
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):

Most commonly used in LANs.

No additional shielding; relies on twisting to reduce interference.

Examples: Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7.

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):

Includes additional shielding to protect from electromagnetic interference (EMI).

Used in environments with lots of potential interference (e.g., factories).

Requires grounding.

2. Cable Categories & Specs
Cat5e: Up to 1 Gbps, 100 MHz.

Cat6: Up to 1 Gbps (10 Gbps for short runs), 250 MHz.

Cat6a: Up to 10 Gbps, 500 MHz.

Cat7/Cat8: Higher speeds and shielding for data centers.

3. Connector Types
RJ-45: Most common for Ethernet connections.

RJ-11: Older phone lines.

4. Cable Standards
TIA/EIA-568A and 568B wiring standards (color codes for Ethernet).

Importance of matching standards on both ends of the cable.

Straight-through vs. Crossover cables.

5. Signal & Interference Concepts
EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)

Crosstalk

NEXT (Near-End Crosstalk)

FEXT (Far-End Crosstalk)

6. Distance Limitations
Standard max for twisted pair: 100 meters (328 feet).

Signal degradation over distance—why proper planning matters.

7. Tools and Testing
Cable testers and tone generators.

Verifying pinouts and continuity.


Coaxial Cable
It's not as common for modern LANs, but still widely used in specific applications like broadband internet, CCTV, and older networking setups.

Coaxial cable consists of several layers:

Inner Conductor – Carries the signal (usually copper).

Dielectric Insulator – Separates the inner conductor from shielding.

Shielding (braid or foil) – Protects against EMI.

Outer Jacket – Protective casing.

🔧 Types of Coaxial Cable
Cable Type	Impedance	Common Use Case
RG-6	75 ohms	Cable TV, broadband internet (modern standard)
RG-59	75 ohms	Older CCTV systems, short video connections
RG-58	50 ohms	Older Ethernet (10BASE2 "Thinnet")
🔌 Connectors
BNC (Bayonet Neill–Concelman): Used in CCTV, test equipment, legacy networks.

F-Type: Used in cable TV and broadband internet setups (screw-on).

📘 Topics You’ll Cover in Network+
✅ Use Cases
Connecting cable modems to ISP networks.

CCTV and surveillance systems.

Legacy Ethernet (e.g., 10BASE2).

✅ Signal Characteristics
More resistant to EMI than twisted pair.

Can support longer distances than UTP in some cases.

✅ Limitations
Bulkier and less flexible than twisted pair.

Not typically used in modern enterprise LANs.

🧪 Testing & Troubleshooting
Tools like cable testers and TDRs (Time Domain Reflectometers).

Signal loss (attenuation) and impedance mismatches.


Fiber Optic Cable
Lives at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI Model just like twisted pair and coax. But fiber is on another level in terms of speed, distance, and EMI resistance.

🌐 Fiber Optic Cable – OSI Layer 1 (Physical Layer)
🔍 How it Works
Uses light (not electricity) to transmit data.

Data is transmitted via LEDs or lasers through a glass or plastic core.

Immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) because it's optical, not electrical.

🔧 Fiber Types
Type	Core Size	Light Source	Max Distance	Typical Use
Single-mode (SMF)	~9 microns	Laser	Up to 100 km+	Long-haul, WANs, telco
Multimode (MMF)	50–62.5 microns	LED	Up to ~2 km (less with higher speeds)	LANs, data centers
🔌 Connectors (You'll Need to Know These)
Connector	Description
ST	"Stick and twist" – bayonet style
SC	"Square connector" – push/pull
LC	"Little connector" – small form
MTRJ	Duplex connector, often for MMF
Tip: LC and SC are the most common in modern setups.

📘 Key Topics in Network+
✅ Speed & Bandwidth
Fiber can handle speeds 10 Gbps to 400 Gbps+ depending on the transceivers and infrastructure.

Higher bandwidth than copper, perfect for backbone and high-performance needs.

✅ Distance
Much longer cable runs than twisted pair or coax:

MMF: 300–2000 meters.

SMF: 2–100+ kilometers.

✅ Advantages
Immune to EMI/RFI.

Highly secure (tapping is harder).

Lightweight and smaller diameter.

✅ Disadvantages
More expensive.

Fragile—needs proper handling.

Requires specialized equipment for installation and testing.

🧪 Testing & Tools
OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer) – tests fiber length and detects faults.

Light meters – check signal strength.

Cleaning kits – fiber ends must be spotless for signal integrity.

🧠 Quick Tips:
Use UTP for most standard Ethernet networks.

Use STP in EMI-heavy environments (e.g., factories).

Use Coax for TV, CCTV, or legacy broadband.

Use Fiber when you need speed, distance, and EMI immunity—great for backbone and WAN links.
