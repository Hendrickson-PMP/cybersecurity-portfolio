Firewalls are filters of networks.

Stateless Firewall: 
-Examines incoming and outgoing packets individually, without considering their relationship to previous network activity. 
-Applies predefined rules to filter traffic, but does not keep track of connections. 
-Faster but less intelligent in blocking sophisticated threats.

Stateful Firewall: 
-Remember and analyze traffic patterns. 
-Monitor ongoing connection.
-Track the state of communication sessions and make decisions based on previous interactions. 
-More secure, as it can detect suspicious activity based on prior exchanges.

Access Control List (ACL)
-Controls traffic in both directions.
-Provides basic security for network.

ACL + Router = Caveman Firewall

Proxy Server
-Privacy & Anonymity: hide your IP address, making it harder for websites to track your location and browsing habits.
-Security: filter traffic, block malicious sites, and prevent access to certain content.
-Access Control: manage employee internet usage, restricting access to specific sites.
-Performance Optimization: caching frequently accessed web pages, reduce load times and save bandwidth.
-Geolocation Bypass: allow users to access content that is restricted in their region.
