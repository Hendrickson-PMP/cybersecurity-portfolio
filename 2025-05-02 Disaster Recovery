CIA Triad
Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized access
Integrity: Ensuring data remains accurate, consitent, and unaltered by the unauthorized
Availability:  Ensuring authorized users can have access

High Availability - Always on
                    Always available

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum allowable downtime before business operations must resume. It defines how quickly systems need to be restored after a disruption. Example: If RTO is 4 hours, operations must be back up within that time.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time. It determines how much data can be lost without significant impact. Example: If RPO is 30 minutes, backups must be frequent enough to ensure data loss does not exceed that timeframe.

Key Difference:

RTO focuses on restoring operations promptly.

RPO focuses on minimizing data loss within an acceptable window.



Type	        Definition	                                                   Recovery Speed	               Cost	      Example Use Case
Hot Site 	    Fully operational backup site with real-time data replication	 Fast (minutes to hours)	     High	      Critical operations needing near-instant recovery, like financial institutions
Warm Site     Partially equipped backup site with infrastructure          	 Moderate (hours to days)	     Medium	    Businesses that can tolerate some downtime but need a quicker recovery
              in place but requires data restoration
Cold Site     Basic facility with power and networking,                      Slow (days to weeks)	         Low	      Organizations with longer RTO/RPO tolerances that can rebuild systems from scratch
              but no pre-installed infrastructure or data

Key Differences:
Hot sites minimize downtime but are expensive to maintain.
Warm sites balance cost and recovery speed.
Cold sites are cost-effective but require extensive setup during a disaster.


LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol): A protocol used to combine multiple physical network links into a single logical link to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy. Commonly used in switches to enhance network resilience.

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): A network protocol that prevents loops in Ethernet networks by creating a spanning tree. It ensures only one active path exists between devices, preventing broadcast storms.

Data Chain: A sequence in which data is processed, stored, and transmitted across a system. Often used in database management and blockchain structures.

Round Robin: A scheduling method that distributes tasks or requests sequentially across multiple resources. In networking, itâ€™s used for load balancing by directing requests evenly across servers.

Load Balancing: The process of distributing network traffic or computational tasks across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overload. Methods include Round Robin, Least Connections, and dynamic routing.

Cluster: A group of connected servers or devices that work together as a unified system for high availability, scalability, or parallel computing. Used in cloud computing, database management, and big data processing.
